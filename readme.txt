In this project, some local and global temperature data were analyzed, and the temperature trends where I live (Lagos) were compared to overall global temperature trends.

The project aims to create a visualization and prepare a write-up describing the similarities and differences between global temperature trends and temperature trends in Lagos. 

The summary of the full analysis is contained in the 'Project Submission' file.
